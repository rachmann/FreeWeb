MVC 5 with Dapper supporting IdentityFramework and Three.js for UI

I added some DB attributes like [Key] in my own spin-off of the SqlMapperExtensions class

I wanted a template for the latest MVC 5 Template with Three.js as the UI. 

The three.js part is just starting; all I have is the viewport working with an Earth and moon model...

The ultimate goal is to have a fast business app, available from anywhere, with a new front end that's super easy to use.
